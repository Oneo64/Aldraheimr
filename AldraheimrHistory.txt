[Some time around 3500 BCE]
Linklontina, an ancient centaur kingdom, rose to power in the midst of the Mountains of Bark. They were the first inhabitants of those mountains they reigned over.

[Before 2000 BCE]
Baln existed a few hundred years before. They were the first dwarven settlement, and they spoke Primordial.

[2000 BCE]
Hathklosh rises in the Heirfgrian Forest.

[1930 BCE]
Haear is formed.

[1860 BCE]
Haear was attacked by an invasion of earth and stone elementals, whom all came from a different plane. After the people of Haear was able to defend themselves, a group of mercenaries were sent by King Anzudengot to find its source and stop it. They travelled to a Krikihbolg Stone Fortress, a fortress embedded inside a massive cavern. They entered the fortress and soon found an elemental portal, the source of their foes. They destroyed the portal that lead the elementals to Miðjorðr, stopping the invasion.

Inglimpara is formed where Heirfgria is now.

[1800 BCE]
Inglimpara starts a conquest, known as the Inglimparan Conquest. They seized Hathklosh, leading to their demise.

[1770 BCE]
Baln was running low on food. They started to take exessive food from the village to feed their soldiers, and so there was a revolution, and was transformed into Banir, under new kings. Primordal branched into a new language, called Primordial Dwarven.

[1540 BCE]
Kiliidhuuk rises, built in the mountains in between of current day Banod and Heirfgria.

[1140 BCE]
Banir collapsed, due to an economy problem. The people moved west, appointing a few new kings. This became known as the Banod.

[1120 BCE]
The Kingdom of Haear eventually collapsed, splitting into two kingdoms, Borusdalis and Veilodin. But when this happened, Inglimpara attacked Borusdalis, destroying it. Refugees fled to Veilodin, while some escaped to east to form Borusdaliandur. Again did Inglimpara strike, perishing the Kingdom of Kiliidhuuk.

[910 BCE]
Borusdaliandur formed a peace treaty with Veilodin. Borusdaliandur was lead by a sorcerer named Borusdagl. Inglimpara tried to attack Veilodin, but were intercepted by Borusdaliandur's army. Inglimpara lost. Borusdaliandur then sent an army to besiege Inglimpara-occupied Kiliidhuuk, defeating the kingdom as revenge.

[900 BCE]
After a long time of planning and preparation, the kingdoms Borusdaliandur and Veilodin were ready for the final Invasion of Inglimpara. They successfully took over Inglimpara and ended the conquest they ran.

[830 BCE]
Shaefklimper rises in the Heirfgrian Forest.

[740 BCE]
A group of earth elementals attacked Borusdaliandur, at a district named Namiam. Ther was a warrior named Hondaf. He was of average height, and his hair was brown. He who lived there took a mace and axe, and defended it. He lost his axe, but was able to destroy most of the elementals before he retreated due to injury, letting the guards and soldiers deal with the rest. He was gifted a star glising, which was named Star Glising of Namiam.

Beliefs: Hondaf is a tall muscular figure with long blond hair. His tomb is cursed by the spirit of himself. See "StoriesAndOtherLiterature/TheLegendOfHondaf.txt"

<First Age of Peace START>

[760 BCE]
Hondaf died a natural death. His body was buried in a memorial along with his Star Glising of Namiam, which was then moved to a tomb. The tomb is now protected by spells (Symbol and Intricate Runic Staves).

<First Age of Peace END>

[680 BCE]
Veilodin collapsed, when a massive disease broke out. It was an incurable disease at it's time. A few hundred people traveled to Borusdaliandur. However, to stop mass migration and potential disease outbreak, Borusdaliandur had artillery to try and kill any immigrants that tried to enter. Almost half of them died to either disease, or the massacre, known as the Veilodin Migration Massacre.

[650 BCE]
Borusdaliandur fell. The people of Veilodin traveled south, to the Taribian desert. They formed an empire, named Zarapib. Zarapib was also led by a sorcerer, named Junas.

[610 BCE]
Junas was assassinated by a group of bandits. Zarapib almost collapsed, but was saved by Haronin using a spear to fend off the bandits. He became a hero right after the bandits fled, and was given the title of emperor.

[550 BCE]
Emperor Haronin died.

[490 BCE]
A group of explorers from Zarapib decided to travel north, to where current day Centruma is. They established a settlement called Grutorus, which would in the future become a village, then town, then kingdom.

[450 BCE]
Zarapib collapsed, and Tarib rose, taking over it's remains.

[360 BCE]
Grutorus fully became a kingdom.

[200 BCE]
Shaefklimper collapsed.

Beliefs: Shaefklimper's collapse (and most of it's reign) is a mystery.

[Exactly AD 0]
Grutorus collapsed. From the remains of Grutorus, a two new kingdoms rose. Galabrus, and Cantrium. Cantrium was now where current day Cantruma is, and Galabrus was many kilometers northwest of Cantrium.

Beliefs: The King of Grutorus killed himself because of stress.

[AD 30]
An priceless, but recently made artifact, a stone tablet containing a poem in Ancient Grutorian, was made by a scribe of yore. This scribe lived in a forgotten Galabric settlement. But tragedy struck when it was attacked in result of a civil war, and was utterly abandoned. It was only several years after that unfortunate event did they remember this tablet. But when an adventurous group decided to search the ruins of this settlement, they found nothing. A group of fey, one dryad and several centaurs, had already taken the tablet. And that dryad was Lànassil.

[AD 40]
An ideology of retribution sprouted in the Kingdom of Wassatila, quickly taking over. Wassatila is an ancient kingom in Veldalfheimr, inhabited by dryads and centaurs. The idea of this ideology was the intelligent races in Miðjorðr were destroying nature, and even Talmundur (God of Nature, Storms, and Luck) by burning wood, killing animals, and even go as far to call wizards cultists. There were just a little more fey that followed this ideology than the ones that didn't. The ones that opposed this ideology stayed far away from Wassatila, some even fled to Miðjorðr.

Lànassil was one of the few that actively opposed it, joining in the local fey military that fought against this. A few years later when they attacked the region she lived in, they killed her tree and stole her tablet. Lànassil then fled to Miðjorðr spent the rest of her life living in Lantheressil Forest.

[AD 50]
Heirfgria is created. A group of centaurs traveled north.

[AD 55]
The group of travelers settled in what is now Vatakond.

[AD 220]
The centaur settlement transforms into Vatakond.

[AD 350]
Galabrus was destroyed. Banodic explorers traveled, and created Mornesvid.

Beliefs: The gods destroyed Galabrus who "greatly and mightily" defied them. (really there's no explaination)

[AD 355]
Banodic explorers traveled from Banod again, and created Glomdur.

[AD 410]
Cantrium went under revolution, becoming current day Centruma.

[AD 500]
_Yûmlathnar_ is created.

[Exactly AD 548]
A large group of explorers from a Galabric village traveled up north. It was led by Bentolus, Garaldor, Þungwaz and Muntin.

[Exactly AD 550]
The large group of explorers unknowingly enterd the territory of a large bandit group, who named themselves the Kynnigwaz. During the fighting, Bentolus and Þungwaz was slain. Their bodies were buried in a tomb.

A week later, the remaining group established a new settlement: Thaldranga.

[AD 560]
The King of _Yûmlathnar_ gets corrupted, and used propaganda to make the people believe humans and dwarves are possessed by demons.

A group of explorers from Centruma went northwest, and settled a village which they named Middellhallde. Middellhallde eventually became a fortress, and the center of what would become the Kingdom of Rotherland.

[AD 600]
Thaldranga became Þalmundrínga.

Meanwhile, some explorers traveled up north from Rotherland. They established their kingdom in the taigas, and created Herthland.

[AD 640]
From the settlement Þalmundrínga, Fjalland rises.

Beliefs: Jóki was a warrior from the village Hrafandis. He traveled north to explore a tomb, but was met by the draugr Tiwaz. Jóki described Tiwaz as "He looked like a rotting corpse. Big as a bull, boated and black like boiling tar. He had the strength of many men, and appeared and vanished as he pleased." Luckily, Jóki was able to defend himself by throwing rocks at the draugr before making his escape.

<Second Age of Peace START>

[AD 650]
As Fjalland slowly rose to power, a group of explorers decided to leave Fjalland to establish their own kingdoms. They traveled east to the coast and settled there, on a fjord that overlooked the ocean, forming the Kingdom of Vuntarla. But at their new land, some decided that the fjord wasn't enough to please their exploration, so they built a longship and set sail to the ocean. They sailed south, to the lands east of Centruma where they settled the Kingdom of Aodesvu.

[AD 870]
Centaurs were spotted scouting in the forests of Fjalland.

<Second Age of Peace END>

[AD 905]
Fjalland invades Antaragen, Vatakond. Antaragen was successfully captured. They turned it into an outpost.
_Yûmlathnar_ launches assault upon Glomdur, bringing chaos. Glomdur barely survives due to not having much defense experience, and only because _Yûmlathnar_ only took resources.

[AD 911]
Fjalland launches a raid on Bravosh, Vatakond. This was also successful. _Yûmlathnar_ offered help to Vatakond, who did accept.

[AD 918]

King Alfþórr of Fjalland dies of old age. His son, Alfþórr the Second, takes his father's place as king. The first thing he did was to launch a military campaign to wipe as many bandit camps as they could in a year. They destroyed around 20 camps, which were about half of all the camps.

[AD 934]
Jeiruld sets up an arcane school in Tarib called the Academy of Aldorim. The academy's main focus is evocation, and now serves as the common training school for Fjallandic war wizards.

[AD 962]
_Yûmlathnar_ surprise attacks Bantusea. The attack was partially successful, half the town destroyed. Centruma sent an army to Vatakond, but was intercepted by Vatakond's forces, and were flanked by _Yûmlathnar_'s army mid-battle. Centruma's army retreated.
