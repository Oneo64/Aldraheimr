this world is of course in its incomplete state. so heres the plan (for now): turn traditional fantasy races into their mythological counterparts


banod embraces its scottish culture
glomdur embraces slavic
mornesvid takes on kagalarian for its main language

ranudel embraces its chinese culture, and needs a new language and it will resemble mongolian
esrelu becomes celtic
