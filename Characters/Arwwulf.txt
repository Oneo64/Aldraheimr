[[DESCRIPTION]]
Arwwulf is a fish merchant and a guardian of Riverrtunn. He has grey eyes, pale skin, and long, rugged brown hair. His height is about 5'10". Arwwulf wears a woolen green cloak, a light brown tunic, brown pants, a belt, and a pair of boots. He has a quiver of arrows, and a 12-inch seax sheathed on his belt. And as for jewelry, he has a plain brass circlet fit on his head. Whereever he goes, he always carries his longbow with him, earning him the name Arwwulf.

Arwwulf can either be seen patrolling Riverrtunn, drinking red wine while watching the rest of Rivertunn go by its life, spearfishing, or selling the fish that he catches. He has a selling-stand set up in front of his home where he sells his fish during resting days (or weekends as we call it).



[[PERSONALITY]]
Arwwulf is harsh, yet fiercely protective of his town. When not patrolling, he enjoys red wine and spearfishing.



[[ABILITIES]]
Arwwulf, being the eager guardian he is, is skilled with his longbow. He can also throw a spear, especially when he's spearfishing. He natively speaks Rotherlandic (Early Middle English).
