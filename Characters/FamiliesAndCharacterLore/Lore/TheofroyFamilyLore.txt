[Year 971]
Ysole decides to paint her shield blue. She also got a surcoat, and dyed it purple using a portion of her family's wealth.


[Year 972]
Using her sei√∞r magic, Ysole sensed a group of undead approaching from an unknown direction. She alerted the guards, but they did not believe her. About ten minutes later, a group of bonemen approached Pendlas Mus, wielding spears/axes with shields. The guards were quick to gather, and they killed the bonemen with Ysole's help.

But during that fight, Ysole felt extremely and unusually uncomfortable the presence of those bonemen. After this, she began to excessively dislike undeath.
