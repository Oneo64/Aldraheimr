[[DESCRIPTION]]
Hammin is one of Randúlfr's knights. His hair is short light-blond and curly, his eyes are pale green, and has fair skin. He also has a light stubble for a beard.

He wears a tan cloak, a yellow tunic, dark grey pants, a ring belt, and a pair of shoes. He wears a iron Talmundúr amulet, and an iron arm ring. He also sports a spear, and a round shield slung on his back. His round shield is painted white and blue.



[[PERSONALITY]]
As a knight, Hammin is loyal to Randúlfr as in honor. He is also an extrovert, as he likes to talk and usually acts as a front for Randúlfr. Hammin would act caring to people he sees as vulnerable, especially physically. However he doesn't like centaurs, and may jump to conclusions without much thought.

He has strong Fjallandic accent, and speaks Rotherlandic weirdly. When speaking in Rotherlandic, he speaks Rotherlandic using Fjallandic grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with Rotherlandic words.



[[ABILITIES]]
Hammin can speak Fjallandic as his native language. He can also speak some Rotherlandic (Early Middle English) even though it isn't fluent. He practices combat with a sword and shield, and knows how to ride horses. He can also play the board game Plattrægnall.
