[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ingwaz is a draugr that dwells in the ancient castle ruins in the peninsula southwest of Esrelu. Ingwaz appears to be bloated and black, with oily skin, greyed out eyes, and sparse black hair. He stands at about 5' 11".

He wears a suit of lamellar, worn pants, a belt and a pair of shoes. On his head sits a coppergate helmet with an obvious dent in it, suggesting that was the killing blow. He carries an atgeir, and a sheathed longseax on his belt.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Ingwaz like many draugr, is extremely and violently protective of his valuables.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ingwaz is skilled with the atgeir he carries, and also with his longseax. He can only speak Galabric. Like many draugr, he sits at his burial spot with absolute stillness until one disturbs his equipment, then he will rise.

Also since Ingwaz is a draugr, he has a few abilities only they can have. He possesses the ability to move arms that were broken, as if they weren't broken. He is also able to turn himself into a billow of mist, or disguise himself as a deer, elk, or moose.
