[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ljorn is a warrior who sometimes utilizes galdrastafir and potions. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior. His long hair is dark blond with gentle but messy waves and is just a little longer than shoulder length. He has a light stubble and fair skin. Oftentimes, his hair is pulled back, then secured by a cloth strip that he tied around his head. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people.

When Ljorn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a Petersen Type L sword (5-lobed Viking sword). On his belt, he has a leather pouch and a small seax under the sword baldric. He wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

When he travels or is preparing for combat, Ljorn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield. He will also carry a thin grimoire (about thirty pages) that has stave-drawing and potion-brewing instructions and a piece of coal in the pouch.

Ljorn is close friends (from childhood) with Meyrúna. He can be found at his house either chopping firewood, checking his family's farm for weeds, playing Plattrægnall with someone (probably with Alfrir), or helping carry wood Alfrir and Ulfrir have felled back to their home. Sometimes, he will go into the forest to harvest potion herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Ljorn is kind to people close to him, reserved, and slightly introverted. He is also stubborn, and sometimes rather not take any suggestions that change what or how he wants to do something. He doesn't like getting himself involved in the affairs of others. Ljorn has a slight paranoia of deep forests, which was because he saw a draugr in one at the age of 10.

The way he talks in Rotherlandic is weird. Not only he has a strong Fjallandic accent, he speaks Rotherlandic using Fjallandic grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with Rotherlandic words. When he gets frustrated, he would quietly use strong language under his breath but doesn't use extreme insults.

He enjoys venison and would carry dried strips of some of it in his pouch for later.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ljorn usually fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities are slightly above average. Ljorn has combat experience from raiding an old castle ruins, where he fought a couple of draugar. Because he was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a centaur raid, his left arm was weakened.

Ljorn has access to magical staves and potion recipes because of his grimoire. He usually has the grimoire open while he draws a stave or brews a potion because he doesn't bother to memorize them. He doesn't draw staves during combat for obvious reasons.

Ljorn's native language is Fjallandic, but he can also speak Rotherlandic (Early Middle English) and Esrel. He knows how to play Plattrægnall, a local board game.
