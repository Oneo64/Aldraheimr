[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ljorn is a warrior who sometimes utilizes galdrastafir and potions. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior. His long hair is dark blond with gentle but messy waves and a little longer than shoulder length. He has a light stubble and fair skin. Oftentimes, his hair is pulled back, then secured by a cloth strip that he tied around his head. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people.

When Ljorn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a Petersen Type L sword (5-lobed Viking sword). On his belt, he has a leather pouch and a small seax under the sword baldric. He wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljorn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield. He will also carry a thin grimoire (about thirty pages) that has stave-drawing and potion-brewing instructions and a piece of coal in the pouch.

When at work, Ljorn can be found at his house chopping firewood, checking his family's farm for weeds, or helping Alfrir and Ulfnir carry wood they felled back to their home. In his free time, he would play Plattrægnall with someone (probably with Alfrir), or go into the forest to explore and collect potion herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
To most people, Ljorn is reserved and slightly introverted. His introversion doesn't manifest in the "shy and timid" sort of way, since he can be just as social as a normal person (with some awkwardness). Instead, he is the type to prefer quiet and solitary areas, and not like being roped into things he didn't sign up for, even if it means no harm. Sometimes, Ljorn acts emotionally detached and calm as if he doesn't care, even if he's reacting to something sad. But to people he's warmed up to, like his family or Rúna, he is kindhearted and more emotional than he usually is.

Ljorn is also stubborn and would sometimes not change his mind after settling on it. Ljorn has a slight paranoia of deep forests, which he got after seeing a draugr lurking in the nearby forests at the young age of 10, and after encountering the gvarth during his trip to the castle ruin.

Ljorn speaks Rotherlandic (Early Middle English) weirdly. Not only does he have a strong Fjallandic accent, but he speaks Rotherlandic using the grammar of his native tongue. When he gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he doesn't use extreme insults or belittling.

Towards Rúna, Ljorn is a little soft-spoken and feels a degree of protectiveness for her from outside threats, especially situations he would perceive as similar to the centaur raid that happened just a few months prior. He expresses his love by doing things for her, spending dedicated time with her, and sometimes, he likes to hold hands.

Ljorn's favorite food is venison, and keeps a small bag of dried strips of it in his pouch for later. And for some reason, he also enjoys dried, hard bread with the crust. He says it's because it's chewy.



[[ABILITIES]]
[Physicality]
Ljorn fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities with weapons are slightly above average. He knows Glíma and learned how to do basic blocks, strikes, and disarms. He has combat experience from a previous adventure to an old castle ruins, where he fought a couple of draugar. But because he was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a centaur raid, his left arm was weakened.

[Grimoire]
Ljorn has access to magical staves and potion recipes because of his grimoire. He usually has the grimoire open while he draws a stave or brews a potion because he doesn't bother to memorize them. He doesn't draw staves during combat for obvious reasons.

[Language]
Ljorn's native language is Fjallandic, but he can also speak Rotherlandic (Early Middle English).

[Games]
Ljorn knows how to play Plattrægnall, a local board game.
