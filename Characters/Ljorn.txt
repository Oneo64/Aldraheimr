[[DESCRIPTION]]
Ljorn is a warrior who sometimes utilizes galdrastafir and potions. He stands at 5'9" and has an average build for a warrior. His long hair is dark blond with gentle but messy waves and a little longer than shoulder length. He has a light stubble and fair skin. Oftentimes, his hair is pulled back, then secured by a cloth strip that he tied around his head. His eyes are hooded, downturned, and dark pale blue, making him seem sad or tired to many people.

When Ljorn is outside, he dons a woolen brown cloak to keep himself warm and dry. Casually, he wears a muted blue tunic, brown pants, a belt, and leather boots. He has a baldric carrying a scabbard with a Petersen Type L sword (5-lobed Viking sword). On his belt, he has a leather pouch and a small seax under the sword baldric. He wears a necklace of an iron Talmundúr amulet.

When he travels or prepares for combat, Ljorn puts on a nasal helmet and his byrnie, and he equips himself with his spear and round shield. He will also carry a thin grimoire (about thirty pages) that has stave-drawing and potion-brewing instructions and a piece of coal in the pouch.

When at work, Ljorn can be found at his house chopping firewood, checking his family's farm for weeds, or helping Alfrir and Ulfrir carry wood they felled back to their home. In his free time, he would play Plattrægnall with someone (probably with Alfrir), or go into the forest to explore and collect potion herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
To other people, Ljorn is reserved and slightly introverted. His introversy doesn't manifest in the "shy and timid" sort of way, since he can be just as social as a normal person (with some awkwardness). Instead, he is the type to prefer quiet and solitary areas, and not like being roped into things he didn't sign up for, even if it means no harm. Sometimes, he may act a little detached, but never cold. But to those already close to him (especially Meyrúna), or people he has warmed up to, he is not detached, but kindhearted and soft-spoken. Ljorn is also stubborn, and would sometimes not change his mind after settling on it. Ljorn has a slight paranoia of deep forests, which he got after seeing a draugr lurking in the nearby forests at the young age of 10.

To Meyrúna, Ljorn feels a degree of protectiveness from outside threats, especially threats like the centaur raid that happened just a few months prior.

Ljorn speaks Rotherlandic (Early Middle English) weirdly. Not only does he have a strong Fjallandic accent, but he speaks Rotherlandic using the grammar of his native tongue. When he gets frustrated, he quietly uses strong language under his breath, but he wouldn't use extreme insults or belittling.

Ljorn enjoys venison. He usually has a small cloth bag of dried strips of it, kept in his pouch for later.



[[ABILITIES]]
Ljorn usually fights with a spear and shield, and his combat abilities are slightly above average. Ljorn has combat experience, gained from a previous adventure to an old castle ruins, where he fought a couple of draugar. But because he was shot in the shoulder with an arrow during a centaur raid, his left arm was weakened.

Ljorn has access to magical staves and potion recipes because of his grimoire. He usually has the grimoire open while he draws a stave or brews a potion because he doesn't bother to memorize them. He doesn't draw staves during combat for obvious reasons.

Ljorn's native language is Fjallandic, but he can also speak Rotherlandic (Early Middle English) and Esrel. He knows how to play Plattrægnall, a local board game.
