Alignment: Neutral
Ethnicity: Rànûdan
Race:      Moon Elf

Brother:   Sasöl



[[DESCRIPTION]]
Melethör is a mercenary moon elf from Emeröreslu. He has smooth light blue skin, and straight purple hair down to the shoulders. His eyes are grey and pupiless, and his ears are long and pointed.

He wears a dark aqua tunic, brown pants, a belt, and boots. When in combat or travelling, Melethör wears a leather helmet, a suit of lamellar, and carries around a fangtian ji as his main weapon, and a liuyuedao sheathed in a scabbard.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Melethör is calm and somewhat playful. Like his brother (Sasöl), he would sometimes engage in horsing around during free time, which could be seen as harmless mischief by other people. Melethör is reserved, but he isn't introverted at all, meaning that he will stay just as quiet but doesn't care about how many people are around him.



[[ABILITIES]]
Melethör speaks Rànûdan and Centrumic (English). However, when he does speak in English, he usually uses an OSV word order. He is proficient in acrobatics and stealth, evident when he can silently perch on a tree branch or hop between them without falling.

In combat, Melethör is above average with his halberd. If he loses his halberd in a fight, he can pull his scimitar out as a backup, but he isn't as skilled with it compared to when he has his halberd.
