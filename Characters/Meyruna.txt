[[DESCRIPTION]]
Meyrúna is a woodcarver who carves small things for her father to sell at the local marketplace. She is slim and curvaceous, and her height is 5'4". She has long, armpit-length, light brown hair that is wavy and flows freely. Her eyes are large and pale green, and her skin is pale with a slight reddish hue with soft freckles scattered across her face.

When she is outside, she tends to wear a dark yellow woolen cloak with a slightly frayed edge, held by a bronze double brooch with a chain. She casually wears a simple muted blue dress, a braided leather ring belt, and leather shoes. On her belt, there is a small seax in its sheath for defense. She wears a necklace with an iron Talmundúr amulet.

Meyrúna is friends Yngvild, who she met from childhood. She can usually be found in her home making wood carvings, and would sometimes would accompany Ljorn into the forest to explore and collect herbs.



[[PERSONALITY]]
Meyrúna is slightly introverted, preferring to be in places where there aren't much people she doesn't know. Most times Meyrúna is unassertive, shown when she would avoid conflict by not associating herself with it. To people who is emotionally close (friends, family, etc), she is calm and pleasant. When she is with Ljorn, she can be slightly bashful due to being inexperienced. Meyrúna avoids Hjalvir due to his arrogant and argumentative personality.

Meyrúna likes to eat a stew of chicken and local spices.



[[ABILITIES]]
Since Meyrúna is a woodcarver, she can carve small things. She can play the lyre, however she isn't brave enough to play it in the presence of strangers. She practices herbology too, and can identify many common herbs in the Northern region. She also knows how to brew a Potion of Restlessness.

Meyrúna can only speak Fjallandic fluently, but she has a minor understanding of Esrel and can speak it if she reads from a script or practices a sentence. She can also read and write them, but only in Fjallandic runes.
