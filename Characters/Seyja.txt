[[PERSONALITY]]
Seyja is bold, fiery, and has a patriotic spirit for the kingdom. She likes to keep organized and tidy. She can also be analytical and strategize things before doing it. For fun, she secretly likes to give other people titles like a nickname, but won't actually use them.

The way Seyja talks in Rotherlandic is weird. Not only she has a strong Fjallandic accent, she speaks Rotherlandic using Fjallandic grammar and phrases, as if the words were replaced with Rotherlandic words.

Seyja's favorite food is salted potatoes, roasted until the skin is semi-crispy. She has a soft spot for animals, especially dogs.



[[ABILITIES]]
Seyja can speak Fjallandic and Rotherlandic (Early Middle English). She has trained with her sword and shield, and her combat abilities are above average.
