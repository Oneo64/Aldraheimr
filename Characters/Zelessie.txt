[[ABILITIES]]
Zelessie has skills in stealth and acrobatics, and she can move quietly if she wants. She has some skill in the shortsword and dagger, but it wouldn't meet the average skill of warriors. She speaks Esrel as her native tongue, but that is the only language he knows.

Because she is a Cold Elf, she has slight nightvision and has natural resistance to cold weather.
