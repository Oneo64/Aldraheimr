The Neck, or Nykkr, is a mythological spirit that is said to appear next to rivers. The Neck is described as a beautiful white horse with zero imperfections, zero flaws. If you approach the Neck, he will let you pet him. But as soon as you touch his tail, you become entranced and as he walks into the river, taking you with him, you drown and die.
