[[STRUCTURE]]
The Academy of Aldorim is an arcane school in Tarib. It is a small three-story school, about 50 x 50 meters in area. It is made of limestone. It is then surrounded by a waterless moat, with a sturdy wooden bridge built across the gap to the academy.

Placed along the road are banners in blue written in the Elvish script: "Sorûsse gwin inde, fàerel gwandar-yûlàera fa!", which in Rànûdan it means "Be aware, ahead is magical activity!"
