The Mountains of Bark are a very mountainous region in the southeast lands of Myrkjorðr. The mountains are so jagged that they are karsts instead of a mountain range. The forest that lives on these mountains consists of tall pines and large oaks, growing on top of the mountain peaks or on the steep cliffs.

This forest contains a limestone shrine dedicated to Hærrulfyr, the God of Emotions. It's rumored that it was built by alfar, but no one really knows who built it, or why.
