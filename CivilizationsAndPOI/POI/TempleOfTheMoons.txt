The Temple of the Moons is an ancient structure built at the northwest coast of Herthland, devoted to the three moons of the world. From the bottom, gravel paths lead upwards to three different hills, each hill with a bell tower made of limestone standing on them. This place is occasionally visited by Herthlandic pilgrims. It's rumored that it was built by alfar, but no one really knows who built it, or why.
