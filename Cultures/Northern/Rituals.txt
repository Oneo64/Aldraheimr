Rituals



[[OFFERING RITE]]
Once the season starts to warm or cool, one would attend a ritual where they sacrifice a doe to Talmund√∫r. This ritual is done at dusk, and is usually set in a clearing next to their village. It is set up by building a bonfire with the slain doe under the wood, which is then covered in a mixure of all sorts of healing herbs, spiritual growth herbs, and protection herbs. The doe's tail must be removed first. Once all set and gathered in a ring around the bonfire, they light the bonfire. Once the bonfire is lit, each attendant must have a runestick with their name carved on it, and throw it in the fire. When everyone's runesticks are in the fire, they can leave.
