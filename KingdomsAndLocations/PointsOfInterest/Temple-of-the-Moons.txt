Temple of the Moons



[[DESCRIPTION]]
The Temple of the Moons is an ancient structure built at the northwest coast of Esrelu, devoted to the three moons of the world. From the bottom, gravel paths lead upwards to three different hills, each hill with one of the towers standing on them. This place is occasionally visited by cold elven pilgrims.
