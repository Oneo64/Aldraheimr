Pronunciation examples here are with an American accent. If you don't have an American accent, you can search the word up like "(word) meaning", "(word) pronuncation", "how to pronounce (word)", etc.

TBH I'm too lazy to explain the entire IPA key for like six of my conlangs, what sounds to use where, blah blah blah.
