"In a time long past, thousands of years ago, there was a town called Namiam in the far south, where the snow doesn't fall, and where men built limestone walls. A man named Hondaf lived in this town. He was strong and had hair of gold, yet he had no fame. Because he was a warrior, he wielded a mace and a war axe."

"Once, a band of earth elementals (or earth-giants, as they called them) attacked Namiam from the western lands. So with his mace and war axe, he boldly leapt onto the first and cleaved it down with his axe. With his mace, he struck another four more with two blows on each. Unfortunately for him, before he could kill them all, they hewed his leg. He fled from them, with only two remaining, and leaving the rest to be killed by the guards."

"For his deeds, the lord of his town saw him worthy of a mace named Star Glising of Namiam. Now, he is dead, buried inside his tomb. Until now, his weapons still lay within his tomb, and rumors say that they still shine as if clean, and that his ghost cursed his own tomb, spreading the curse to all who dare enter."
