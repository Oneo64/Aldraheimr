"In a time long past, thousands of years ago, a man named Hondaf was there. He was strong and had hair of gold. Once, a band of earth elementals attacked his town. So with his mace and war axe, he leapt onto the first and cleaved it down with his axe. Unfortunately, his leg was struck by them. He fled, with only two remaining, leaving the rest to be killed by the guards. For his deeds, the lord of his town saw him worthy of a mace named Star Glising of Namiam. Now, he is dead, buried inside his tomb."
