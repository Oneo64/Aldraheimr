[AD 905]
From their seeresses, the Kingdom of Fjalland knew what the fey were trying to do. They struck first, invading the village of Antaragen in Vatakond. They successfully seized it and turned it into an outpost of their own. The kingdom launched another raid, this time on Bravosh.

The kingdom Wulfscithia offered help to Vatakond, who accepted.


[AD 918]
Vatakond attacked Bantusaem of Centruma, a kingdom in the south. But they couldn't get past their defenses and retreated. King Gardorus, the current ruler of Centruma at the time, knew of this, and for revenge, he ordered an attack on Ainattor and destroyed it.


[AD 955]
Many years have passed, but now Fjalland is prepared. They began the first invasion on Wulfscithia, but lost the battle.


[AD 960]
Wulfscithia sent their army up north and attacked the village of Solstunn, Herthland. Solstun was almost ruined, but they were able to recover after many months.


[AD 968]
Fjalland and Herthland sent an army to attack Ealdmandring in Wulfscithia, one of their settlements, and pillaged it.


[AD 972]
Wulfscithia decided to begin their attack on Þuryngard, the capital of Fjalland. But before they could reach the fortress, their army was intercepted by Fjalland's army and quickly fled. At the same time, Vatakond raided Argánlaf, which was half-successful since they pillaged it, not destroyed it.
